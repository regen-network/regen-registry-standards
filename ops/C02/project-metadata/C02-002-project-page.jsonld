  "regen:storyTitle": "The Sandy Cross Forest Preservation Project: Preserving Urban Wildlife Habitat and Benefiting Local Community",
  "regen:story": "The Sandy Cross Forest Preservation Project protects a 132-acre forest on a 214-acre property in the Mansfield, Ohio metro area. The forest contains a diverse, mature tree population (~85 years old) with species including: American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Quercus alba) and tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). The Sandy Cross Forest Preservation Project sequesters carbon and protects wildlife habitat and open space.\nPreservation of the Sandy Cross Forest is crucial as intact forests of this size are becoming increasingly rare in Richland County, Ohio due to agricultural development and urban expansion. Surrounding forested land is being rapidly converted into agricultural land and is facing a continued threat of urban expansion from the Village of Lexington which exists adjacent to the Project area.\nThe Western Reserve Land Conservancy is a 501(c)(3) non-profit land trust committed to providing the Ohio region with essential natural assets through land conservation and restoration. The goal of the Sandy Cross Forest Preservation Project is to protect the forest in perpetuity through a conservation easement. WRLC holds a divest portfolio of protected lands, 102 easements representing over 8,000 acres in Geauga County. The property will be monitored annually to ensure its natural resources (including mature forest) are upheld to standards identified in the conservation restrictions. Layers of legal protection and stewardship monitoring granted through the easement terms will ensure continued provision of conservation benefits for generations to come. \nThe Sandy Cross Forest Preservation Project offers the residents of Northeast Ohio a variety of community and conservation benefits, including equity for underserved communities, open space benefits, human health benefits, and bird and wildlife habitat benefits. \nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Richland County is a historically disadvantaged region. Too often, disadvantaged communities are subject to industrial development; the preservation of the Project’s mature forests will ensure development does not occur and that air quality, water quality and viewshed benefits remain. \nThe Project’s mature forest will also help mitigate flooding by absorbing rainwater, slowly releasing it back into the watershed. A single large canopy tree can absorb between 500 to 760 gallons of rainwater over the span of a year while stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The Project’s forest also significantly impacts air quality, as a single mature tree can absorb up to 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year. These combined air and water quality benefits will increase over time as the forest matures.\nThe Project is also located within a migratory flyway, and its forested habitat provides essential stopover habitat for neotropical migratory birds, species that rely on large, intact stands of deciduous trees in Northeast Ohio along their migration route. Additionally, surveys conducted on the Project confirmed the presence of red-backed salamanders, a pollutant intolerant species that signifies the high-quality nature of the Project area."
