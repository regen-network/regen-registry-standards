Western Reserve Land Conservancy's forest conservation creates community benefits including carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, and open space protection. Preservation of the large, diverse intact forest is increasingly rare in Richland County due to rapid agricultural development and continued threat of urban expansion from the adjacent Village of Lexington.",

  "regen:story": "The Sandy Cross Forest Preservation Project protects a 132-acre forest on a 214-acre property in the Mansfield, Ohio metro area. The forest contains a diverse, mature tree population (~85 years old) with species including: American beech, sugar maple, red oak, white oak and tulip poplar. The project sequesters carbon and protects wildlife habitat and open space.  Preservation of the Sandy Cross Forest is crucial as intact forests of this size are becoming increasingly rare in Richland County, Ohio due to agricultural development and urban expansion. Surrounding forested land is being rapidly converted into agricultural land and is facing a continued threat of urban expansion from an adjacent village. \nThe goal of the project is to protect the forest in perpetuity through a conservation easement. The property will be monitored annually to ensure its natural resources (including mature forest) are upheld to standards identified in the conservation restrictions. Layers of legal protection and stewardship monitoring granted through the easement terms will ensure continued provision of conservation benefits for generations to come.\nThe project offers locals a variety of community and conservation benefits. Too often, disadvantaged communities like Richland County are subject to industrial development. The area’s forest helps mitigate flooding and significantly impacts air quality, with both of these benefits increasing over time as the forest matures. The preservation of the project’s mature forests will prevent development and ensure air quality, water quality and viewshed benefits remain.\nAdditionally, the project’s forested habitat provides essential stopover habitat for migratory birds that rely on large, intact stands of deciduous trees in Northeast Ohio along their migration route. Surveys conducted on the project also confirmed the presence of red-backed salamanders, a pollutant intolerant species that signifies the high-quality nature of the project area."
