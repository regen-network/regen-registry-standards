  "regen:story": "Outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, <a href=\"https://alleghenylandtrust.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Allegheny Land Trust</a> has protected 124 acres of woodlands from rapidly encroaching residential development in southeastern Allegheny County. The 40-year-old maple, cherry and oak-hickory forest provides habitat for deer, turkey, and many species of birds. Hikers, birders, and mountain bikers are able to explore the area, and possibly catch a glimpse of a majestic 200-year-old oak tree. \nIn addition to providing recreational and aesthetic benefits, Buena Vista Heights Conservation Area contributes as part of the solution to many pressing issues the Pittsburgh region is grappling with today as a result of our industrial past: aging infrastructure, challenging topography and landslides, and climate change-induced rain events causing flood damage. Protection of this forest also contributes to maintaining clean drinking water for the Pittsburgh region’s residents. Located within the lower Youghiogheny River Watershed, the property is five miles upstream from the Monongahela River.\nAllegheny Land Trust (ALT) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization helping local people save local land in the Pittsburgh Region. Together with local communities, they’ve protected more than 3,500 acres of scenic landscape, biodiversity hotspots, and forests, improving water quality across 36 different municipalities in Allegheny and Washington Counties. In addition to their preservation work, they improve the quality of life for current and future generations by offering recreational and educational opportunities. Revenue generated from the sale of carbon credits will be put towards land acquisition costs, land stewardship, and future expansion of this and other conservation lands."
