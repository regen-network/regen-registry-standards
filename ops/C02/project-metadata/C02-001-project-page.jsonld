  "regen:story": "King County Urban Forest Carbon Project is a tree preservation project that protects and preserves 15 acres of high value conservation lands in urban areas and urban separators at Soaring Eagle Regional Park in King County, near Sammamish, Washington. King County’s Forest Carbon Project confronts climate change by offering local companies the opportunity to offset their carbon emissions, keeping forests intact in the region and making it possible for their employees and their families to explore and enjoy the protected outdoor spaces.\nThe Puget Sound region, including the Seattle metro area, is growing rapidly. The Forest Carbon Project is a component of the Land Conservation Initiative, a 30-year vision to protect 65,000 acres of the most important remaining natural lands and urban green spaces for residents of the region. King County has identified 1,500 acres of high-value urban forest to be preserved and will be acquiring lands with its city partners throughout the coming years. The first acquisition in 2019 was a 15-acre addition to Soaring Eagle Regional Park near Sammamish, WA. King County is a local government in Washington State; the 2018 Urban Forest Carbon Project is part of the County's Forest Carbon Program, which is a component of the Land Conservation Initiative, a 30-year vision to protect 65,000 acres of the most important remaining natural lands and urban green spaces for residents of the region. \nThis project provides a cleaner urban environment by improving urban air quality and enhancing water quality in surrounding rivers, lakes, and the Puget Sound. It provides critical salmon habitat and preserves corridors for elk, bears, and other wildlife in an increasingly fragmented, paved-over landscape. It also provides communities with the diverse physical and mental health benefits of green space, with access to spaces to gather, relieve stress, relax, play, and learn outdoors."
