  "regen:story": "The Harvey Manning Park Expansion Preservation Project’s 15.14-acre site is part of a 33-acre property in the forested “Issaquah Alps” comprising the Tiger, Squak, and Cougar Mountains that rise above Lake Sammamish and connect to other public lands. \nThe <a href=\"https://www.issaquahwa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">City of Issaqua</a> has worked with community members, King County, and the Trust for Public Land for several years to protect this site. These ecocredits allow for the protection of the 100+ year old forest, consisting of mature mixed conifer and deciduous trees including Douglas Fir and Big Leaf Maples. Preservation of this native forest will store carbon, provide stormwater benefits, and contribute to the City’s 51% tree canopy coverage. The forest structure provides diverse habitat and pollinator plants that provide food and shelter for wildlife. The site also includes riparian and wetland habitat that supports wildlife corridors on Cougar Mountain and protects cool freshwater streams that feed Tibbetts Creek, a salmon-bearing waterway and tributary to Lake Sammamish.\nThe site is uniquely positioned within Issaquah city limits, the region’s urban growth boundary and the Mountains to Sound Greenway National Heritage Area corridor. The site preserves critical habitat connection to other publicly held lands on Cougar Mountain, and protects the forested hillside on Cougar Mountain from development and retains it as protected open space."
