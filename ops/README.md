# Regen Registry Ops

Welcome to Regen Registry Ops. This repo contains the metadata for all
projects, credit classes, and credit batches live on Regen Ledger, and should
be used in conjunction with SHACL schemas defined in [Regen Registry
Standards](https://github.com/regen-network/regen-registry-standards) to
generate IRIs for querying metadata based on its content hash. Metadata should
be stored in JSON-LD files copied from the Regen Registry Standards repo with
the appropriate information and filled in with the appropriate information.
