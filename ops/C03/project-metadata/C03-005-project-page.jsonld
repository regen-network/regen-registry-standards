  "schema:description": "The Florestal Santa Maria REDD+ Project is the world’s largest remaining rainforest situated in the Amazon, Brazil. Home to 10% of the world’s species, this project protects their habitats from deforestation through regular satellite monitoring and on-site surveillance, as well as incentivizes the restoration of degraded areas. The long term goals of this project are to hand operations over the local community, a goal being achieved through the establishment of a technical school and community forest management courses.",
